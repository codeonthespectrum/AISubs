# **Video Subtitle Generator with Language Detection and Translation**  

This project is a **Python-based** application that automates the process of generating subtitles for videos in any spoken language. It uses OpenAI's Whisper model for accurate transcription and automatically translates the generated subtitles into *Brazilian Portuguese*. The result is exported as a `.srt` file, which can be easily added to videos using media players or video editing software.  

The application is designed to handle *large video files* (up to 10GB) and is ideal for filmmakers, educators, or anyone working with multilingual content.

*Generated `.srt` files are accurate and can be used directly with most media players. In this example I used VLC*
